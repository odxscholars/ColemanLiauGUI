# CLI-GUI
This project is the team's submission to our first hackathon, DefHacks 3.0 Hackathon. This project consists of a GUI that was built using Python TKinter to make automating the process simpler and visually appealing. The program is designed so you can input as much .txt files you want without having to re-run the entire program.

## Coleman-Liau Index

The Coleman-Liau Index is an index used by educational institutions to measure the reading level of a given text or book. This index is important in assigning students from a certain grade level to the appropriate books.

## Libraries required to run the program:
- Pillow  - The Pillow library is used for the image/s that are used within the program/GUI.
- Tkinter - The Tkinter Library is used for the creation of the GUI and processing of it.

## Installation 

- Download the ZIP.
- Extract file in desired directory.
- Open Terminal in directory.
- Run "python3 ColemanLiauGUI_Main.py" (However, you can rename the file to anything you want).
- Input desired .txt file to check its CLI Index.
